                                    Over the next three years we will be developing a best-in-class fan experience and year-round entertainment and leisure destination at the Etihad Stadium.

                                    <br />
                                    Our plans include several connected all-weather facilities, fully integrated into the stadium, centred around an expanded North Stand with one larger, single upper tier above the existing lower tier, increasing capacity to over 60,000.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />

                                    A covered City Square fan zone, with capacity for 3,000 people and a wide variety of food and drink outlets, a new club shop, museum, workspace and a 400-bed hotel will also be constructed.
                                    <br />

                                    Although we will be working hard to minimise disruption on matchday, there will be some changes to the way the Etihad Stadium and the wider Etihad Campus operates during the construction period.

                                    This page will be regularly updated with everything you need to know when visiting the Etihad Stadium this season.
